pacman version COVID

## Presentation
This is a pacman, COVID version, one randomly chosen player starts as 'contaminated', loses 0.2 HP regularly (each time deplacements() function is called).
In order to stop this contamination and prevents any other, the agent (autonomous or not) has to go in the vaccinated zone in the middle.

This game can be played with 2 players, one with the arrows and one with the ZQSD keys.

You win when you reach 100 points.
You lose if the two playable players both can't move (reach 0 HP)
